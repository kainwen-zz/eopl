## Typer

* CHECKED: eopl7.3 language

## Some small compilers

The code generating method here is using string:join, and of course it is ugly.

* let2erlang: A small compiler that compiles letlang to erlang.
* let2ml: A small compiler that compiles letlang to sml.

To compile dynamic type language to static type language, there are some bugs in let2ml, one of them is "Y combinator"(The code generated by let2ml does not type check).

Another problem is that how you can be confident with the correctness of your compiler(interpreter) without formal proof?
